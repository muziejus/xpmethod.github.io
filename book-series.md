**On Method** book series from Columbia University Press publishes concise, provocative
reflections on the process of *doing* research in the humanities. From close reading to
curatorial practice: critical making, mapping, walking, computing, annotating, visualizing,
collecting, or experimenting---on the street, in the lab, or in the archives---the series
presents advanced practitioners of their craft in dialogue with their materials, tools, and
techniques.

The editorial collective seeks proposals for book projects of 30,000--50,000 words, which
articulate a single method: explain its history, its possibilities, and limitations. Addressed
to a wide audience across disciplines, we would like for our volumes to inspire novice readers
as well as to challenge accepted orthodoxies. Spurning the tedium of jargon-laden meta
commentary, we prefer strong authorial voices, who write with passion about their craft.

Edited by Dennis Yi Tenen, Marta Figlerowicz, and Manan Ahmed along with current
